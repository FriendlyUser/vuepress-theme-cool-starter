## Disclaimer

As of `vuepress@1.7.1` I cannot get this starter template running with vuepress installed globally, it throws an error message for me.


## ReadMe

This is an example of how to use the `vuepress-theme-cool` vuepress theme, look into docs for example files.

## Installation and Running

To install:

`npm install`

To run with vuepress installed locally:

`npm install vuepress --save-dev`

`npm run docs:dev`


## Customization

Most of the customization is done in `config.js`, automatic navbar and sidebar navigation is available in `config-other.js`

Some other good vuepress examples can be found at [vuepress-examples](https://vuepress-examples.netlify.com/)
